# ch20stringBinaryTree

Create a project for a binary tree that holds strings. The code in the book is for a binary tree that holds integers. You can use that code and switch it to handle strings. Use the code in the IntBinaryTree.h file near the front of the chapter, and the code in the IntBinaryTree.cpp file that appears before the Tying It All Together example near the end of the chapter. Both files are available in the student resources on the book's web site. You can put these 2 files together into the .cpp file that holds the main function, if that is easier. Convert all of the necessary references from integer to string.

In the main function, combine several of the examples discussed in the book. Insert several strings and show the tree in order, pre-order, and post-order traversals. Delete two strings and display the results. Note that the first deletion is the root node which has 2 children; check carefully that the child sub-trees have been merged together correctly. The results look like this:

Take a screenshot that matches this sample. Then change the names to different words and run the project again. Take a screenshot of that second version.

NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.

Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots AND the root folder for the project.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
